**Objective**:
The aim of this project is to create a console-based quiz application where users can participate in a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and receive a score at the end. The program should be interactive, allowing the user to answer a series of questions, track their progress, and display the final score.

This project is a great way to practice fundamental C programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, and basic input/output handling.

**Key Features**:

The quiz will consist of multiple-choice questions, where each question will have four options, and the user will select one option.

**User Input Handling**:
The user will be prompted to answer each question by selecting a corresponding option (usually using numbers 1-4).

**Scoring System**:
The program will track the user's correct answers and calculate the final score at the end of the quiz.

**Feedback**:
After each question, the user will receive feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
